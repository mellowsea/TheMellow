### An Equilibrium of Conscious Reality 

After the inches of snow have fallen,

After the crystals of ice compact 

Beneath my neighbors' feet,

Circles 

Upon circles 

Swirled into the yard. 

Through the thin gridded screen, 

I gaze down on its circumference:

Past moments pressed into shoes 

Squeezed with the snow

Between the earth and toes.
<br>

In my eyes  

Streak the pathways

Sharpening up the whole maze 

Step by step.
<br>

(An equilibrium of conscious reality)
<br>

There is no snow in my head-- 

no feet or circles either. 

My hands are not made of words 

My fingers not wrapped in rhythm. 

Yet here are all these letters 

In the shape of what has been.

Two minds creating language 

Entangled across time.
