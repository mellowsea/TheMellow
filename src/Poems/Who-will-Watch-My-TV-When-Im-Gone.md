### Who will Watch My TV When I'm Gone?

Who will watch my TV when I'm gone? 

What will happen to its green circuitry? 

I spent so many years 

In it's pearlescent glow

Just like they all wanted me to, 

The people in my TV. 

Armies of people 

With cameras 

And make up 

And schedules 

Small businesses 

Small Cities 

Pitched up for a weekend or a month 

With so much electricity. 

All for me 

To watch on my energy saving 34" garage sale Dyanex. 

Who would've thought 

A peasant like me 

Could have so many jesters

At my disposal? 

An infinite parade 

Of the most talented nobodies 

Your eyes have ever seen--

And that's just the smaller productions. 

Oh the Big Budget! 

Years of work 

From hundreds of lives 

Pressed down into a few glorious hours 

Leaving so many to wonder 

How the heck do these things make money? 

But here they are 

Brilliant 

Shining 

Distractions

To have and to hold 

Till death 

Do I part.
