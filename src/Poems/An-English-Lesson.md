### An English Lesson

Who taught you how to hear

The shapes before you  

In the space between your ears?  
<br>
  
Or maybe there is no voice;

A tacet understanding  

My mind cannot abide.  
<br>
  
But in this holy moment  

Of communion in your mind  

We are one.  
<br>
  
(Though it cannot be all.) 
<br>
  
Imprisoned by words  

An unchosen home

An encrypted fortune 
<br>
  
Unless we were born

Unless we were studied 

In multiple forms.
<br>
  
For some who look,

Nothing but lines  

And their absence.
