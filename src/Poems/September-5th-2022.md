### September 5th, 2022

I'd be lying if I said I was happy here. 

But I would also be lying if I said I was not happy here. 

Happiness has become a default setting for my machine. 

The lie is impatience and delusion. 

It separates me from the now. 

Where I could be thrilled 

And engaged 

And so attracted to this existence. 

But in most moments I am predicting the future 

Imagining what could be

And what couldn't. 

But because I know this. 

But because I recognize myself being myself. 

I can be happy here. 

And I am happy here. 
<br>

The lie is regret and self-pity. 

Where I am torturing 

And rehashing 

And so sorry for the humans I've hurt. 

In many moments I am reliving the past. 

Imagining what could've been 

And what wasn't 

But because I know this. 

But because I recognize myself being myself. 

I can be happy here. 

And I am happy here. 
<br>

The lie is assumption and obsession. 

Where I am pretending 

And rumenating 

And so sure that my friends despise me. 

In many moments I am spinning up conversations I'll never have. 

Imagining what was left unsaid 

And what could be said. 

But because I recognize myself being myself. 

I can be happy here. 

And I am happy here.
