### I Am Surrounded By An Ocean

When my head  is underwater

Submerged in the rapids of life

My arms grasp for dryness 

Whatever works to get me breath
<br>

If I can be comfortable 

Holding my breath 

I can find the shore. 
<br>

But my mind is hot 

With wetfire 

Boiling all the water around me 

I must get out 

I must get out 
<br>

If I can be comfortable 

Feeling on fire 

I can find the shore 
<br>

But it all must be done

My life is at stake 

A convulsion away

From sucking in my surroundings 

And floating with the currents 
<br>

If I can be comfortable 

Leaving this life

I can find the shore.
