### This World is Cruel.

This world is cruel. 

And when I asked "Why?",

It asked me "Why not?". 

And when I asked it to back off,

It demanded I stand my ground. 

And when I asked it why it would make flowers,

It tossed me among the cactuses.

And when my body was bleeding, 

It chased me -- more hungry than before.

And when I begged it to cease, 

It trampled over me. 
<br>

And when my head laid between the world's monstorous feet 

staring up through an endless storm

I asked, "Why do I love you?" 
<br>

"Well, what else could you do?"
