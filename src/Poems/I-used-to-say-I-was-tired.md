### I Used to Say I was Tired

I used to say I was tired  

When people asked how I was  

What I really meant to say  

Was I'm tired of being tired  

Was tired of feeling my feelings  

Was tired of being alone 
<br>

I got tired of saying I was tired  

So I started saying I was good.  

Even though inside I was exhausted  

I got good at saying I was good.  

So good that I thought I was good.  

That the melancholic 2am's  

Searching the hallways  

And lawns  

And empty classrooms  

And bar stools  

For someone who I could be tired with. 
<br> 
  
I am good now.  

I'm only tired when I need sleep  

And I am excited for the morning.
